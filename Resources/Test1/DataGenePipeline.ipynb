      " \n",
      "In this paper we use micro-level data on stor e traffic, sales and labor from 41 stores of a large \n",
      "retail chain to identify the extent of understaffi ng in retail stores and quantify its impact on  \n",
      "sales and profitability. We show how traffic data  can be leveraged in making staffing decisions \n",
      "through use of a structural model that captures the relationship between traffic, sales and labor. \n",
      "Assuming that store managers aim to maximize pr ofits, we estimate the contribution of labor to \n",
      "sales and impute the cost of labor for each store in our sample. We find significant \n",
      "heterogeneity in the contribution of labor to sal es as well as imputed cost of labor across these \n",
      "stores and across time. Using the estimated parameters, we establish the presence of systematic understaffing during peak hours. Aligning staffi ng levels with changing traffic patterns can \n",
      "result in a 6.15% savings in lo st sales and a 5.74% improvement in profitability. We describe a \n",
      "pilot implementation of our approach at anothe r large retailer where we identify periods of \n",
      "understaffing in their stores and document the im pact on conversion rate and lost sales.   \n",

      " 1. Introduction \n",
      "The ability to meet shifting customer demand in a timely  and cost-effective manner is an important driver \n",
      "of retail store performance.  Retailers need to match in-coming traffic with labor to provide a consistent \n",
      "quality of service to their customers. This has led ma ny retailers to invest in customer-facing technologies \n",
      "to gain access to micro-level data on  customer behavior, such as customer  arrival patterns, in each of their \n",
      "stores. However, to improve their service quality, retailers need business analytical tools that will \n",
      "effectively utilize these traffic data to deliver insights useful to improve staffing decisions. In the absence \n",
      "of such business analytical tools, retailers would face the common problem of “drowning in numbers but \n",
      "lacking in insight” (Fisher and Raman, 2010, p4). In th is paper, we present an approach that enables a \n",
      "retailer to effectively utilize customer traffic data to  develop a robust staffing plan for each individual \n",
      "store.  \n",
      "Devices that track customer traffic in a store have evolved over the years from simple counting \n",
      "instruments to highly refined thermal imaging tec hnologies These devices are now able to provide a real-\n",
      "time count of incoming customers to a store in as small as 15 minute intervals. Popular vendors in this market are ShopperTrak, SMS, SensorSource, Traf-S ys etc. Some of the retailers actively tracking \n",
      "customer traffic include high-end fashion retailers (e .g. Prada USA, Neiman Marcus), furniture retailers \n",
      "(e.g. Ashley Furniture, La-Z-Boy), and electronic reta ilers (e.g. HH Gregg, Apple). Most retailers tend to \n",
      "use traffic data to track store perfo rmance metrics like traffic growth, conversion rate and basket value. \n",
      "These performance metrics are then used  to measure efficacy of marketing campaigns and to compensate \n",
      "store managers. The opportunity to use traffic data to  improve labor planning remains largely unexplored. \n",
      "Recent academic research suggests that store traffic data may be useful to improve staffing decisions. \n",
      "Perdikaki et al. (2012) show that 1% increase in la bor results in a 0.5% increase in conversion rate in \n",
      "women’s apparel stores while Ton (2009) finds that a one  standard deviation increase in labor at a store is \n",
      "associated with a 10% increase in prof it margin over the course of the year. However, it is unclear how \n",
      "retailers should go about increasing la bor. An across the board increase in labor is unlikely to be optimal. \n",
      "One approach would be to use store traffic data to  identify hours when a store is understaffed and increase \n",
      "labor during those hours. Alternatively, retailers ma y determine if there are hours when the store is \n",
      "overstaffed so they could reallocate labor from those peri ods to hours when their st ore is understaffed. In \n",
      "this paper, we present a methodology that utilizes tra ffic data to identify periods during a day when a \n",
      "store is overstaffed and periods  when it is understaffed.  \n",
      "Understaffing and overstaffing durin g different times of the day occur due to several reasons \n",
      "including lack of flexibility and forecast errors (Lam  et al. 1998; Quan 2004). First, employers need to \n",
      "provide minimum shift lengths to their employees either  due to quality of life c onsiderations or due to \n",
      "union rules or state laws. Due to the minimum shift length requirements, managers may be reluctant to 3 \n",
      " schedule additional employees for short periods of time  to meet peak demand. Second, store traffic is \n",
      "unpredictable leading to forecast errors that result in  erroneous staffing decisions. Thus understaffing and \n",
      "overstaffing at the hourly level will occur in retail st ores even if managers were optimally planning the \n",
      "store labor at the daily level. Though understaffing and overstaffing are normally  expected in any retail \n",
      "store, the extent of under- and over- staffing and thei r impacts on performance has not been studied so far  \n",
      "Overstaffing could lower profits because of higher labor costs. Understaffing, on the other hand, \n",
      "could impact both short-term as well as long-term pr ofitability. In the short-term, understaffing could \n",
      "result in customers turning back without purchasing, and over the long-term it may result in customers \n",
      "switching to competitors due to poor service. Dissatis fied customers may also express their discontent at \n",
      "other forums, including social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter, causing retailers to \n",
      "worry about the negative word-of-mou th effect (Park et al. 2010). Unde rstaffing also negatively impacts \n",
      "store associate satisfaction (Loveman 1998) and declin e in employee satisfaction has been linked to \n",
      "decline in store’s financial perform ance (Maxham et al. 2008). Thus the negative impact of understaffing \n",
      "is potentially much higher than that of overstaffing.  \n",
      "Our aim in this paper is to leve rage detailed traffic data, combine it with point-of-sale (PoS) data on \n",
      "sales and transactions, and labor data to estimate the extent of understaffing a nd overstaffing in a retail \n",
      "setting and estimate their short-term impacts on sales and profitability. We use hourly data collected over \n",
      "a period of 1 year from 41 stores of a large specialty apparel retail chain, Alpha1. The relationship \n",
      "between store traffic, sales and labor are captured in  a structural model through a sales response function \n",
      "and a cost function. The sales response function helps us determine how traffic and labor contribute to \n",
      "revenue while the cost function helps us determine the imputed cost of labor used by store managers to \n",
      "make their labor decisions. We use structural estimat ion techniques to determine the parameters of the \n",
      "sales response function and cost function from the da ta.  Since the sales response function and cost \n",
      "function could vary by store and time, our estimatio n is performed separately for each individual store \n",
      "and separately for weekdays and weekends. By allowi ng for heterogeneity in the estimated parameters \n",
      "across stores and time, we implicitly capture the di fference in underlying customer traffic patterns at \n",
      "different stores. Using each store’s sales response f unction and cost function, we construct the optimal \n",
      "labor plan for each store, and explore the extent and impact of the deviation between the actual labor and \n",
      "the optimal plan. \n",
      "A fundamental challenge in structural estimation is ensuring that the underlying structural model \n",
      "reflects economic realities of the decision maker. We undertook several measures to ensure our model \n",
      "validity. First, our underlying mode l is derived from prior literature (Lam et al. 1998) to increase external \n",
      "validity. Second, we conduct hypotheses testing to ex amine if the parameters from the underlying model \n",
      "                                                            \n",
      "1 The identity of the retailers have been disguised to maintain confidentiality 4 \n",
      " are consistent with economic behavi or of operating managers identified in prior literature. Third, we use \n",
      "field data from another retailer, Beta, to further validate our model. Specifically, a managerial \n",
      "intervention around staffing in one of the stores provid es a unique natural experiment to examine if the \n",
      "model parameters and leve l of understaffing from before and after the intervention are consistent with \n",
      "expected behavior.   \n",
      "We have the following results in our paper. Firs t, we find significant understaffing during a three-\n",
      "hour peak period in all 41 stores of our sample. Sec ond, we estimate the impact of understaffing on lost \n",
      "sales to be 6.15% and that on profitability to be 5.74% , while the impact of overstaffing on profitability is \n",
      "estimated to be 2.04%. Third, we find that the imput ed cost of labor used by managers when making their \n",
      "staffing decisions exhibits considerab le heterogeneity across stores due to local market characteristics.  \n",
      "This paper makes the following contributions to th e growing research on use of micro-level data in \n",
      "managerial decision making in the retail sector. First, like Alpha and Beta,  many retailers are still in the \n",
      "process of determining ways in which traffic data may be used to improve staffing decisions. By \n",
      "providing a methodology to identify hours when their stores are understaffed or  overstaffed, our paper \n",
      "allows retailers to focus their attention on those limited  periods when they need to improve their staffing \n",
      "decisions. Second, there is a long line of work in operations management that has employed linear \n",
      "programming or queuing theory for staffing decisions (Dantzig 1954; Holt et al. 1956; Gans et al. 2003). \n",
      "Implicit in these papers is the assumption that unders taffing and overstaffing are costly to organizations. \n",
      "Our paper contributes to this literature by estimati ng the impact of understaffing and overstaffing on lost \n",
      "sales and profitability in the retail sector. We show that  the impact of understaffing on profitability could \n",
      "be particularly large, even if one considers just the short-term impact.  Third, our paper contributes to the \n",
      "emerging area of business analytics by demonstrating the value of data-driven decision making in the \n",
      "context of store staffing. We develop a structural  model to capture the relationship between store \n",
      "performance, traffic, and labor in retailer A lpha and perform a pilot implementation at another retailer \n",
      "Beta to demonstrate how organizations can improve thei r staffing decisions. Finally, we contribute to the \n",
      "small but growing literature that empirically analy zes the heterogeneity in managerial decisions across \n",
      "different local markets and the importance of incor porating them in the decision-making process. Our \n",
      "study extends the findings of Campbell and Frei (2010) to the retail sector by showing that store managers \n",
      "take local market characteristics into  account when staffing their stores.  \n",
      "2. Literature Review  \n",
      "Labor planning problems have long been studied in operations management. Starting with the seminal \n",
      "papers by Dantzig (1954) and Holt et al. (1956), sever al papers have developed mathematical models to \n",
      "improve staffing decisions. The objective of these papers is to minimize costs by minimizing the level of over and understaffing. Staffing problems have also b een studied in other service systems like call center 5 \n",
      " settings and health-care settings (Gans et al. 2003; Green 2004; Kc and Terwiesch 2009; He et al. 2012) \n",
      "where the objective is to find optimal staffing schedul es that would minimize the waiting time and costs. \n",
      "Our paper contributes to this literature by providing an  approach to quantify the extent of understaffing in \n",
      "retail stores and its impact on lost sales and profitability.  \n",
      "Empirical research examining the impact of labor  on retail store performance has been gaining \n",
      "importance in the recent years. Several researchers have  examined the impact of labor on store financial \n",
      "performance. Using data from a small-appliances and fu rnishing retailer, Fisher et al. (2007) find that \n",
      "store associate availability (staffing level) and customer satisfaction are among the key variables in \n",
      "explaining month-to-month sales variations. Netessine  et al. (2010) find a strong cross-sectional \n",
      "association between labor practices at different stores and basket values for a supermarket retailer, and \n",
      "demonstrate a negative association between labor mism atches at the stores and b asket value. Ton (2009) \n",
      "investigates how staffing level affects store profita bility through its impact on conformance and service \n",
      "quality for a large specialty retailer. Using monthly data on payroll, sales and profit margins, Ton (2009) \n",
      "finds evidence that increasing labor leads to higher  store profits primarily through higher conformance \n",
      "quality. Our paper differs from the above in its re search question, data, and methodology. We use a \n",
      "structural estimation technique to investigate the pr evalence of understaffing using hourly data on traffic, \n",
      "labor, and sales and quantify its impact on store profitability.  \n",
      "While numerous papers have utilized traffic data on incoming calls to study labor issues in the call \n",
      "center literature, the lack of traffic data has stymie d research in labor issues faced by brick-and-mortar \n",
      "retailers. Lam et al. (1998), Lu et al. (2011), and Perdikaki et al. (2012) are notable exceptions. Lu et al. (2011) use video-based technology to compute the queue length in front of a deli counter at a supermarket \n",
      "and show that consumers’ purchase behavior is driven  by queue length and not waiting time. Perdikaki et \n",
      "al. (2012) characterize the relationships between sales, tr affic, and labor for retail stores. They show that \n",
      "at an aggregate level, store sales have an increasi ng concave relationship with traffic; conversion rate \n",
      "decreases non-linearly with increasing traffic; and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. Our \n",
      "paper differs from Perdikaki et al. (2012) both in its  objective and methodology. Our paper is closest to \n",
      "Lam et al. (1998) who study sales-force scheduling deci sions based on traffic forecast. Similar to us, they \n",
      "quantify the impact of labor scheduling decisions on  store profits. Their analysis was conducted using \n",
      "data from a single store. Our analysis is richer not only because of the use of pa nel data from 41 stores but \n",
      "also because of the methodology employed.  We use a structural estimation technique to impute the cost \n",
      "of labor using past decisions of store managers wh ile Lam et al. (1998) use accounting costs of labor \n",
      "elicited from the store manager to perform their analysis.  \n",
      "Our approach of imputing labor costs based on past  labor decisions has several advantages. Prior \n",
      "research has shown that managers’ perceptions of co sts can be very different from traditional costs 6 \n",
      " (Cooper and Kaplan, 1998; Thomadsen, 2005; Musal em et al. 2010). Also, researchers have advised \n",
      "caution when dealing with information elicited from ma nagers as even experts tend to underestimate or \n",
      "overestimate the actual costs that should be consid ered in decision making (Hogarth and Makridakis, \n",
      "1981; Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993). The use of structural estimation techniques to impute the underlying \n",
      "costs considered by managers in decision-maki ng has only recently been adopted in operations \n",
      "management literature. This approach to estimate cost  parameters from observe d decisions in operations \n",
      "management has been utilized by Cohen et al. (200 3), Hann and Terwiesch (2003), Olivares et al. (2008), \n",
      "and Allon et al. (2011). Cohen et al. (2003) impute th e underlying cost parameters of a supplier’s problem \n",
      "in the semiconductor industry, where a supplier optimally balances his cost  of delay with the holding cost \n",
      "and cost of cancelation in deciding the time to be gin order fulfillment. Hann and Terwiesch (2003) use \n",
      "transaction data on bidding to impute the frictional co sts experienced by custom ers in an online setting. \n",
      "Olivares et al. (2008) look at cost parameters of  the newsvendor problem in the context of hospital \n",
      "operating room capacity decisions, where the optimal capacity decision is obtained by balancing the cost \n",
      "of overutilization with the cost of underutilizatio n. Allon et al. (2011) impute the cost placed by \n",
      "consumers on waiting time at different outlets of fast  food drive-through restaurants. In particular, they \n",
      "consider location characteristics, competition and bran d-specific characteristics in their estimation process \n",
      "and then use these parameters to st udy the effect of reducing waiting time on the firms’ market shares. \n",
      "Ours is the first paper to impute costs in the contex t of retail labor planning. We show that the imputed \n",
      "cost of labor used by store managers varies signifi cantly across stores and is driven by local market \n",
      "characteristics like competition, median house hold income, and availability of labor.  \n",
      "3. Research Setting \n",
      "We obtained proprietary store-level data for Alpha , a women’s specialty apparel retail chain. As of \n",
      "2011, there were over 213 Alpha  stores operating in 36 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the \n",
      "U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. These stores are t ypically in high-traffic locations like regional malls \n",
      "and shopping centers.  \n",
      "Alpha’s  stores are typically less than 3500 sq. ft  with small backrooms. Sales associates at Alpha  are \n",
      "trained to provide advice on merchandise to customers, help ring up customers at the cash register, price \n",
      "items, and monitor inventory to ensure that the store is run in an orderly fashion. There is no differentiation in task allocation amongst the different  store associates and they receive a guaranteed \n",
      "minimum hourly compensation as well as incentives b ased on sales. To emphasize the sales nature of \n",
      "their jobs, these associates are also called stylists. In line  with the trendy clothes so ld by this retailer, the \n",
      "job requirement states that store associates need to  be fashion forward and should maintain their \n",
      "appearance in a way that represents their bra nd in a professional and fashionable manner.  7 \n",
      " We illustrate the typical labor planning process for re tailers in Figure 1. First, retailers determine the \n",
      "sales forecast for each store. The sal es forecast is typically generated at  an aggregate monthly or weekly \n",
      "level. The sales forecast for a store would take into account, among other factors, store specific \n",
      "characteristics, sales trends, new product introd uctions, seasonality, and upcom ing promotions. Next, \n",
      "these sales forecasts are used to determine the aggregate number of labor hours required in a store. An important input to determining the appropriate level of labor is the knowledge of the marginal cost of \n",
      "labor. A profit maximizing retailer is expected to set la bor at the point where marginal revenue is equal to \n",
      "the marginal cost of labor. Once the aggregate labor  hours are determined, workers schedules are created \n",
      "after taking into account several constraints such as wo rker availability, minimum shift constraints, and \n",
      "other government and labor union constraints (Quan 2004).  \n",
      "While the labor planning process described above is typically similar across retailers, there is a wide \n",
      "variation in how it is executed. Many large big-box  retail organizations use centralized planning tools \n",
      "from companies such as Kronos and RedPrairie to pe rform these planning activities and the store manager \n",
      "is only responsible for ensuring the comp liance to labor plan. On the other hand, Alpha  uses a centralized \n",
      "labor planning tool that generates weekly sales forecasts for each store. In addition, they also have traffic \n",
      "forecasts for each store. The store managers at Alpha  use such data as an input to generate number of \n",
      "labor hours required for each day. This involves th e managers’ judgment around how much sales they can \n",
      "expect each day and how much labor would be require d to support those sales activities. Store managers \n",
      "have strong incentives to control payroll expenses in their stores since their bonuses are tied to store \n",
      "profits. Hence store managers strive to incr ease sales while controlling payroll costs.  \n",
      "Alpha  had installed traffic counters in 60 of its stor es located in the United States during 2007. This \n",
      "advanced traffic-counting system guarantees at least  95% accuracy of performance against real traffic \n",
      "entering and exiting the store. This technology has the capability to distinguish between incoming and \n",
      "outgoing shopper traffic, count side-by-side traffic and groups of people, and differentiate between adults \n",
      "and children, while not counting shopping carts or st rollers. The technology also can adjust to differing \n",
      "light levels in a store and prevent certain types of counting errors. For example,  customers would need to \n",
      "enter through fields installed at a certain distance from each entrance of the store in order to be included \n",
      "in the traffic count, thus preventing cases in which a shopper enters and immediately exits the store from \n",
      "being included in actual traffic counts. It also provides a time stamp for each record that enables a detailed breakdown of data for analysis. The hourly tra ffic data along with performance metrics such as \n",
      "conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of tr ansactions to incoming traffic), basket value (defined \n",
      "as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions ), and the labor in the store were available to \n",
      "corporate headquarters as well as store managers at periodic intervals. We use the same data for our \n",
      "analysis.  8 \n",
      " 3.1 Data Description \n",
      "Alpha’s stores were open 7 days a week. Operating hour s differed based on location as well as time \n",
      "period, e.g., weekdays and weeke nds. We obtained operating hours for each store and restricted our \n",
      "attention to normal operating hours. Of the 60 stores, five stores were in free-standing locations and five \n",
      "stores were in malls that did not have a working we bsite to provide additional information needed to \n",
      "determine their operating hours. Moreover, there were nine stores, for which we did not have complete \n",
      "information for the entire year as they were either ope ned during the year or did not install traffic counters \n",
      "at the beginning of the year. Hence, we discard data from these 19 stores and focus on the remaining 41 \n",
      "stores that had complete information. These 41 st ores are located across 17 states in the U.S in \n",
      "malls/shopping centers, and are of similar sizes.  \n",
      "Working with data from one retail chain allows us to implicitly control for factors such as incentive \n",
      "schemes, merchandise assortments, and pricing policies across stores. Data on factors such as employee \n",
      "training, managerial ability, employee turnover and ma nager tenure that could impact store performance \n",
      "are not available to us. We also do not possess in formation on inventory le vels and promotions.  \n",
      " We obtained additional demographic information like the number of women apparel retail stores, \n",
      "total number of clothing stores, population, and me dian household income from EASI Analytics and \n",
      "Mediamark Research, Inc., which provide market re search data collated from the Bureau of Economic \n",
      "Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and U.S. Census Bureau at the zip code level for each \n",
      "store.    \n",
      "3.2 Sampling procedure  \n",
      "Our data set consists of hourly observations fro m January to December, 2007. The retail industry \n",
      "displays significant seasonality in traffic patterns dur ing the year (BLS, 2009) and the traffic pattern also \n",
      "varies considerably between weekdays and weekends. Such variations in traffic could be driven by \n",
      "changes in customer profile visiting the stores (Ruiz et al. 2004). In addition, retailers could react to such \n",
      "variations in traffic by changing the proportion of pa rt-time workers. For example, Lambert (2008) finds \n",
      "that retailers tend to hire more part-time staff on w eekends and holidays. Thus, the parameters of the sales \n",
      "response function and cost function could be differe nt across these time periods. So, we identify sub-\n",
      "samples in our dataset where we expect these parameters  to be similar using hierarchical cluster analysis \n",
      "(Liu et al. 2010). \n",
      "The results of the hierarchical cl uster analysis for a representative store are shown in Figures 2a and \n",

      "In this section we explain the methodology used to determine if retail stores are under or overstaffed. \n",
      "We determine a store to be understaffed in a given time  period if it carries less than optimal labor in that \n",
      "time period. In order to determine the optimal labor, we extract the revenue function and cost function for \n",
      "each store. To do so, we assume that store managers make optimal labor decisions at an aggregate daily \n",
      "level and derive the revenue and cost  functions for each store using historical daily data on sales, traffic, \n",
      "and labor. We justify this assumption based on the in centive structure of store managers whose bonuses \n",
      "are tied to store profits. Using the parameter estimat es, we derive the optimal labor for each individual \n",
      "hour. The difference in actual labor and optimal labor is used to identify understaffing and overstaffing \n",
      "periods in the dataset.  \n",
      "In order to estimate the revenue function and cost  function for each store, we make the following \n",
      "assumptions. First, we assume that the revenue fu nction only depends upon the incoming traffic and \n",
      "amount of labor in the store. Second, we assume consta nt marginal cost of labor in our cost function. The \n",
      "manager knows this marginal cost when making staffi ng decisions but this cost is unobservable to the \n",
      "econometrician. We allow for marginal cost to vary  across stores for the following reasons. First, some \n",
      "components of the accounting costs such as minimum wa ge rate, insurance, and medical benefits could \n",
      "vary across stores based on state laws in the United St ates. Thus stores within the same chain would be \n",
      "paying different wages for similar jobs. Second, the cost of labor could be driven by local market \n",
      "characteristics such as labor supply and customer exp ectations. Local markets with tight labor supply \n",
      "might face high employee turnover. High employee turnover increases labor costs due to increase in costs \n",
      "of hiring and training (Stiglitz 1974) and additional overtime costs till the vacancy is filled (Tziner and 10 \n",
      " Birati 1996). Similarly, managers of stores that are lo cated in markets where customers’ expectation of \n",
      "service is higher might place greater emphasis on service level and assess lower costs to labor. For example, Campbell and Frei (2010) find that operating managers in a retail bank consider market-specific \n",
      "customer sensitivity to service time when they trade-o ff cost versus benefit of service to be provided.  \n",
      "Finally, the cost of labor could depend upon the efficiency of labor and management in each store \n",
      "(Thomadsen 2005).  \n",
      "We use a structural estimation technique to determine the revenue and cost function for each store. \n",
      "Structural estimation techniques are useful to estimat e unobservable or behavioral parameters (Reiss and \n",
      "Wolak 2007). A key decision in structural estimation is  the choice of the underlying model that is used to \n",
      "capture managers’ decision making process. Reiss and Wo lak (2007) state that the choice of the structural \n",
      "model depends upon economic reality, data generating process, and ability to simplify estimation. We are \n",
      "guided by similar principles in our choice of the stru ctural model. This retailer has a centrally planned \n",
      "tool that provides guidelines to the store managers, who then make the labor planning decisions. Prior \n",
      "empirical evidence on store manager incentives suggest that retailers develop incentive schemes for store \n",

      "managers received an incentive compensation based on store profits. Hence, we argue that the store \n",
      "managers’ labor decisions are taken w ith the goal of maximizing store profits\n",
      "2. However, it is challenging \n",
      "to elicit the exact mathematical structure that store managers use to make these labor decisions. Thus, we \n",
      "pursue the following approach. First, we impose a st ructure on the store managers’ decisions based on an \n",

      "We perform a number of robustness checks of our resu lts. First, we rerun our analysis by estimating \n",
      "the parameters of our sales function at the hourly leve l. Recall that the main results were reported based \n",

      "example, we find that the impact of understaffing observed during peak hours on lost sales and \n",
      "profitability to be 5.43% and 4.9% respectively.  \n",
      "Second, we perform a more conservative test of our analysis by using a forecast of traffic instead of \n",
      "actual traffic. We do so because store managers would typically use a forecast of traffic in labor planning \n",
      "decisions. Additionally, we divide our sample in to fi t and test sample so that we may estimate the impact \n",
      "of understaffing and overstaffing in the test sample  using parameter estimates from the fit sample. We \n",
      "find our results to be similar. For example the impa ct of understaffing observed during peak hours on lost \n",
      "sales and profitability with a one-week ahead forecast  of traffic was found to be 4.09% and 3.31% \n",
      "respectively. \n",
      "Third, we use traffic data from a co-located retailer, Gamma, to estimate our moment conditions. \n",
      "Gamma  is a family clothing store and belongs to the same industry sub-segment as Alpha  (NAICS 448 – \n",
      "clothing and clothing accessories stores). Unlike Alpha where we possess hourly data on traffic and labor, \n",
      "we only have daily traffic data for Gamma . We determined that 17 stores of Gamma were co-located in \n",
      "the same mall as Alpha . Hence, we concentrate on these 17 stores. The average correlation between the \n",
      "daily traffic data at the co-located Gamma  stores and Alpha  stores was 51.34% in our sample. Hence we \n",
      "replace the 7 day lagged daily labor data of Alpha  with contemporaneous average daily traffic data from \n",
      "Gamma stores as instruments in equation 7. We obtain similar results as earlier. For example we find the \n",
      "impact of understaffing observed during peak hours on lo st sales and profitability to be 4.32% and 3.56% \n",
      "respectively. The range of lost sales estimate in these 17 stores is 1.49% to 7.15% and the range of \n",

      "6. Pilot Implementation \n",
      "Next we demonstrate the managerial contribution of  our approach through a pilot implementation at \n",
      "another retailer, Beta. Beta is a large specialty retailer with over 100 stores in the United States and \n",
      "Canada. The annual revenue for Beta exceeds 1 billion USD. Beta’s  stores vary in size but each was \n",
      "larger than 10,000 sq. ft. Beta had recently installed traffic counters in  its stores and was using traffic data \n",
      "to determine sales productivity in its stores. At the time of our pilot implementation, Beta was \n",
      "contemplating purchase of labor planning software to improve their staffing decisions and contacted us to \n",
      "identify any understaffing in their stores.   \n",
      "There were a number of similarities between the store managers of Alpha  and those of Beta.  In both \n",
      "cases, store managers were responsible for making la bor decisions and the store managers’ compensation \n",
      "was based on salary as well as bonuses that were tied to store profits. Customer satisfaction metrics were \n",
      "not considered in the performance appraisal of store managers.   20 \n",
      " We followed an iterative cycle of model validatio n and analysis to identify understaffing at Beta’s  \n",
      "stores and estimate its impact on lost sales. This test-and-learn approach to the decision-making process has been advocated in litera ture to ensure that the model provides reliable insights for managers to take \n",
      "appropriate actions (Davenport, 20 09). For our preliminary analysis we obtained data on hourly sales, \n",
      "traffic, and labor for 4 stores in the United States a nd Canada. We supplemented these data with field trips \n",
      "to 3 of their stores and several hours of telephone c onversations with their store managers, district \n",
      "managers, and several managers at the corporate h eadquarters. These conversations revealed that our \n",
      "model from Alpha  could reasonably capture the decision making process of store managers in Beta.  \n",
      "Next, we went through a model validation process, i.e. we tested if the model could accurately \n",
      "capture the underlying relationships betw een store sales, traffic and labor for Beta. Our conversations \n",
      "revealed that a managerial interven tion had occurred in one of their stor es on a staffing issue. We use this \n",
      "intervention as a natural experiment to test the validity  of our model. In May 2011, one of the Canadian \n",
      "stores was asked to reduce their staffing level as it w as deemed to be overstaffed.  This determination was \n",
      "based on the ratio of payroll to sales for this store wh ich was higher than that of comparable stores. Our \n",
      "follow-up calls with the store manager of this Canadian  store revealed that his store became overstaffed as \n",
      "the store was protecting many sales associates from losing their jobs though their sales became weak after \n",
      "January 2011. Once the managerial  intervention occurred, this store gr adually reduced its workforce by \n",
      "not replacing associates who were lost in attrition.  Based on our discussions, we posited that this store \n",
      "manager’s imputed cost of labor should have incr eased after the intervention in May 2011. We also \n",
      "expect that the level of overstaffing should have reduced from May 2011. We examine if our model is \n",
      "able to detect both these changes. We  obtained hourly data on traffic, sales, and labor during the period \n",
      "February–July 2011 for this store. The average hourly sales, traffic and labor for this store was $2309.42, \n",
      "44.02 and 8.54 labor-hour respectively. Then we sp lit the sample into February-April time frame and \n",
      "May-July timeframe to capture the pe riods before and after the manageri al intervention in this Canadian \n",
      "store. We follow the same methodology as described earlier for Alpha  to impute labor costs in these two \n",
      "subsamples and quantify the extent of understaffing and overstaffing for different hours of the day.  \n",
      "Consistent with our expectations, we find that the imputed cost of labor increased from $103.25 to \n",
      "$147.16\n",
      "4 suggesting that the store manager was placing great er emphasis on labor costs. Further, we find \n",
      "that the extent of overstaffing was also reduced.  Earlier, the store was overstaffed for 78.56% of the \n",
      "hours during the time period February-April 2011 but the extent of overstaffing declined to 41.16% \n",
      "during May-July 2011.  Since both results are consistent  with prior expectations, they offer further proof \n",
      "of our model validity.  \n",
      "                                                            \n",
      "4 Recall that these costs are no t directly comparable to wages since these co sts are normalized by store gross margin.  21 \n",
      " In addition to the above results, we obtained the fo llowing unexpected insight for this store. Figures \n",
      "4a and 4b presents the traffic flow for different hou rs of the day during Febr uary-April and May-July, \n",
      "respectively. We notice that the traffic has two sp ikes. The first occurs between 12-3PM and another \n",
      "smaller spike occurs between 4-5PM in February-Apr il. The smaller spike shifts to 7-8PM during May-\n",
      "July as shown in Figure 4b. Our analysis reveals that the store is understaffed during 12-3PM for the \n",
      "entire duration but the store is not understaffed be tween 4-5PM during February-April or May-July \n",
      "timeframes. However, the shift in traffic caused the store to become understaffed during 7-8PM in May-\n",
      "July as the store did not adjust its labor plan. Cons istent with our model pr edictions of understaffing \n",
      "during 7-8PM, we find that the conversion rate declined by 3% during this hour when the store was understaffed compared to when it was not. Our follow -up discussions with this store manager revealed \n",
      "that the traffic pattern shifts in May-July due to warmer weather in Canada. However, the store manager \n",
      "had not taken any specific action to change the labor  plan to match the shift in traffic pattern.  \n",
      "Our analysis of the rest of the stores revealed unders taffing during peak hours in all of them. We also \n",
      "observed a 3-5% decline in conversion rate durin g peak hours when the stores were understaffed. \n",
      "Interestingly, we found that the level of understa ffing in one of the stores was twice on Mondays \n",
      "compared to the rest of the days. We discussed our findings with the store manager to understand if there \n",
      "were any underlying operational constraints that might  lead to this systematic understaffing. We found \n",
      "that while the normal practice was to have store associat es start their shifts at different times of the day so \n",
      "that not all store associates take their lunch breaks at that same time, on Mondays, there was an “all-hands-on-deck” meeting in the morning that requires all the store associates to be present. As a result, \n",
      "majority of the store associates started their shift on Mondays at the same time that in-turn lead to a \n",
      "common lunch-break time for most of the sales associat es. The high level of peak-hour understaffing that \n",
      "we observed on Mondays in this store was a result of this staffing issue.  \n",
      "As we indicated earlier, understaffing and overs taffing occur in retail stores due to schedule \n",
      "inflexibility and forecast errors. To address these issu es, this retailer is considering three different \n",
      "strategies that could improve its staffing flexibility. Fi rst, the retailer intends to examine the efficacy of \n",
      "straddling shifts of full-time workers so that there is sufficient coverage during peak hours. A large body \n",
      "of academic literature has developed mixed intege r linear programming techniques to schedule full-time \n",
      "workers to minimize labor hours while satisfying va riable workforce requirements of a service delivery \n",
      "system (example, Dantzig 1954, Morris and Showa lter 1983). Second, this retailer believes that cross-\n",
      "training of backroom workers could help alleviate th e understaffing problem in the sales floor during peak \n",
      "hours. Cross-training workers to increase flexibility have been well established in the manufacturing \n",
      "arena (Fryer 1974; Daniels et al. 2004). Finally, this retailer is also considering scheduling part-time \n",
      "workers during the peak hours while respecting the mi nimum shift lengths for these workers. In order to 22 \n",
      " test which strategy (or hybrid of strategies) might work, the retailer is planning to conduct experiments in \n",
      "its stores to determine their impact s on conversion rate and profitability.  \n",
      "To summarize, our analysis of Beta’s  data yields the following insights. First, we provide additional \n",
      "evidence of external validity of our model by using a natural experiment at this  retailer. Second, we find \n",
      "our result that retail stores are understaffed during p eak hours to be robust across retailers. Third, we \n",
      "demonstrate the managerial contribution of our approach to identify and quantify the impact of understaffing using a pilot implementation. Our con servative estimate of lost sales for these 4 stores on \n",
      "average was about $240,000 per year, which was roughly 2.5% of their annual sales.  One senior manager \n",
      "commented that, “ We always knew our stores were understaffe d at some times and overstaffed during \n",

      "One limitation of our study is that it is focused on short-term profitability. Prior research has shown \n",

    "text = '''4. Methodology and Estimation  \n",
    "In this section we explain the methodology used to determine if retail stores are under or overstaffed. \n",
    "We determine a store to be understaffed in a given time  period if it carries less than optimal labor in that \n",
    "time period. In order to determine the optimal labor, we extract the revenue function and cost function for \n",
    "each store. To do so, we assume that store managers make optimal labor decisions at an aggregate daily \n",
    "level and derive the revenue and cost  functions for each store using historical daily data on sales, traffic, \n",
    "and labor. We justify this assumption based on the in centive structure of store managers whose bonuses \n",
    "are tied to store profits. Using the parameter estimat es, we derive the optimal labor for each individual \n",
    "hour. The difference in actual labor and optimal labor is used to identify understaffing and overstaffing \n",
    "periods in the dataset.  \n",
    "In order to estimate the revenue function and cost  function for each store, we make the following \n",
    "assumptions. First, we assume that the revenue fu nction only depends upon the incoming traffic and \n",
    "amount of labor in the store. Second, we assume consta nt marginal cost of labor in our cost function. The \n",
    "manager knows this marginal cost when making staffi ng decisions but this cost is unobservable to the \n",
    "econometrician. We allow for marginal cost to vary  across stores for the following reasons. First, some \n",
    "components of the accounting costs such as minimum wa ge rate, insurance, and medical benefits could \n",
    "vary across stores based on state laws in the United St ates. Thus stores within the same chain would be \n",
    "paying different wages for similar jobs. Second, the cost of labor could be driven by local market \n",
    "characteristics such as labor supply and customer exp ectations. Local markets with tight labor supply \n",
    "might face high employee turnover. High employee turnover increases labor costs due to increase in costs \n",
    "of hiring and training (Stiglitz 1974) and additional overtime costs till the vacancy is filled (Tziner and 10 \n",
    " Birati 1996). Similarly, managers of stores that are lo cated in markets where customers’ expectation of \n",
    "service is higher might place greater emphasis on service level and assess lower costs to labor. For example, Campbell and Frei (2010) find that operating managers in a retail bank consider market-specific \n",
    "customer sensitivity to service time when they trade-o ff cost versus benefit of service to be provided.  \n",
    "Finally, the cost of labor could depend upon the efficiency of labor and management in each store \n",
    "(Thomadsen 2005).  \n",
    "We use a structural estimation technique to determine the revenue and cost function for each store. \n",
    "Structural estimation techniques are useful to estimat e unobservable or behavioral parameters (Reiss and \n",
    "Wolak 2007). A key decision in structural estimation is  the choice of the underlying model that is used to \n",
    "capture managers’ decision making process. Reiss and Wo lak (2007) state that the choice of the structural \n",
    "model depends upon economic reality, data generating process, and ability to simplify estimation. We are \n",
    "guided by similar principles in our choice of the stru ctural model. This retailer has a centrally planned \n",
    "tool that provides guidelines to the store managers, who then make the labor planning decisions. Prior \n",
    "empirical evidence on store manager incentives suggest that retailers develop incentive schemes for store \n",
    "managers with a goal of maximizing store prof its (Dehoratius and Raman, 2007). In case of Alpha , store \n",
    "managers received an incentive compensation based on store profits. Hence, we argue that the store \n",
    "managers’ labor decisions are taken w ith the goal of maximizing store profits'''\n",
