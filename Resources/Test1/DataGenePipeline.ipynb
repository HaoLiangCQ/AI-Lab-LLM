      "employees. For instance, retailers such as The Limited\n",

      "we show both the short- and long-term impacts of\n",
      "labor on store performance. In the short term, lower\n",
      "stafﬁng levels are associated with lower conversion\n",
      "rate. In the long term, lower conversion rates are\n",
      "associated with lower trafﬁc growth. As pointed out\n",
      "by Ton (2009) and Fisher and Raman (2010), retailers\n",

      "results highlight the importance of considering traf-\n",
      "ﬁc uncertainty in labor planning. Most labor planning\n",
      "tools use a point forecast of trafﬁc or sales to plan\n",
      "labor and thus ignore trafﬁc uncertainty in their plans.\n",
      "This would lead to greater mismatches between store\n",
      "trafﬁc and labor; such mismatches have been found\n",
      "to have a detrimental impact on store performance\n",
      "(Netessine et al. 2010).\n",
      "2. Literature Review\n",
      "The importance of store labor is underscored in\n",
      "the pioneering work of Raman et al. (2001), which\n",

      "ther proof of the importance of store labor is provided\n",
      "by Ton and Huckman (2008), who demonstrate an\n",

      "and a decrease in proﬁt margin and customer ser-\n",
      "vice. They ﬁnd that this impact is moderated by the\n",
      "level of process conformance of the store. Finally, Ton\n",
      "(2009) shows that an increase in store labor is associ-\n",
      "ated with higher proﬁts through the impact on confor-\n",
      "mance quality but not on service quality. Our paper is\n",
      "similar to the above papers in examining store labor,\n",
      "but it differs from them in that it studies labor in con-\n",
      "junction with trafﬁc, an important variable that was\n",
      "missing in the previous studies.\n",
      "Recent work by Netessine et al. (2010) examines the\n",
      "impact of labor planning and labor execution on store\n",

      "ﬁc, ﬁnding that conversion rate is close to 100% in its\n",
      "setting. Our study complements theirs and also pro-\n",
      "vides new insights. First, we use actual trafﬁc data at\n",
      "a daily level for our analysis. This level of granularity\n",
      "would signiﬁcantly mitigate the aggregation bias that\n",
      "has been commonly found in aggregate data analy-\n",
      "sis (Blundell et al. 1993). Second, our results suggest\n",
      "that trafﬁc variability could be an important driver of\n",
      "the mismatch between store labor and trafﬁc observed\n",
      "by Netessine et al. (2010). So managing trafﬁc vari-\n",
      "ability is an important step toward achieving a good\n",
      "match between store labor and trafﬁc. Attaining such\n",
      "a match may entail the use not only of better plan-\n",

      "of the retailers to determine if any of their actions are\n",
      "increasing trafﬁc variability. Finally, because the con-\n",
      "version rate is not 100% in our setting, we are able\n",
      "to show that trafﬁc variability also impacts conver-\n",

      "Netessine et al. (2010).\n",
      "Next, we brieﬂy review the marketing literature\n",
      "that treats store trafﬁc as a traditional variable of\n",
      "interest. In contrast to our paper, most studies treat\n",
      "store trafﬁc as a dependent variable and study the\n",
      "impact of marketing activities such as advertisements\n",
      "and price promotions on store trafﬁc. Because of the\n",

      "tion and methodology. Lam et al. (2001) use trafﬁc as a\n",
      "dependent variable, but we are interested in studying\n",
      "the impact of trafﬁc on sales performance. Also, their\n",
      "study ignores store labor and trafﬁc variability, which\n",
      "we identify as important factors that affect store sales\n",

      "uses store trafﬁc data to study labor scheduling. That\n",
      "paper uses trafﬁc data from one store to show that\n",
      "the relationship between trafﬁc and sales volume is\n",
      "actually nonlinear. Our paper adds to this evidence\n",
      "by using data from a panel of 41 stores; in addition,\n",
      "we show the moderating role of labor and the impact\n",
      "of trafﬁc variability on store performance, which are\n",
      "factors that Lam et al. (1998) do not examine.\n",
      "Another body of research relevant to our work\n",
      "focuses on conversion rate for online retailers. Even\n",
      "though online retailing is a very recent phenomenon\n",
      "compared to brick-and-mortar retailing, there have\n",

      "we note that, because conversion rate is less than\n",
      "100% in our case, we only observe basket value of\n",
      "customers who decide to purchase. This metric would\n",
      "be similar to basket value in the overall population\n",
      "if the decision to purchase was independent of how\n",
      "much the shoppers were planning to purchase in the\n",
      "ﬁrst place. But we do not believe this to be the case\n",
      "for the following reason.\n",
      "In queueing theory, it is common to assume that\n",
      "customers would renege (or balk) if the waiting time\n",
      "exceeds their maximal willingness to wait, i.e., their\n",
      "patience threshold. The maximal amount of time\n",
      "customers are willing to wait would depend on the\n",
      "perceived beneﬁt they would receive from their pur-\n",
      "chase, because consumer utility is typically assumed\n",
      "to increase with the amount of goods consumed.\n",
      "Therefore, we expect that consumers who are plan-\n",
      "ning to purchase more, i.e., those with larger bas-\n",
      "ket values, would be willing to wait longer. Thus, as\n",
      "trafﬁc increases we expect waiting time to increase\n",
      "as well (for a given level of labor), resulting in\n",
      "greater reneging (and balking) among customers who\n",
      "intended to purchase smaller baskets. Therefore, we\n",
      "expect observed basket values to increase with higher\n",
      "trafﬁc through self-selection. Finally, the decline in\n",
      "basket value for large values of trafﬁc could be driven\n",
      "by stockouts and phantom stockouts in the store. In\n",
      "addition, congested stores may make it harder for\n",
      "store associates to cross-sell and for shoppers to shop\n",
      "around, resulting in lower basket values.\n",
      "Anecdotal evidence supporting our argument can\n",
      "be found. Many retail stores have priority or express\n",
      "lanes, i.e., special checkout counters for customers\n",

    "In this section we explain the methodology used to determine if retail stores are under or overstaffed. \n",
    "We determine a store to be understaffed in a given time  period if it carries less than optimal labor in that \n",
    "time period. In order to determine the optimal labor, we extract the revenue function and cost function for \n",
    "each store. To do so, we assume that store managers make optimal labor decisions at an aggregate daily \n",
    "level and derive the revenue and cost  functions for each store using historical daily data on sales, traffic, \n",
    "and labor. We justify this assumption based on the in centive structure of store managers whose bonuses \n",
    "are tied to store profits. Using the parameter estimat es, we derive the optimal labor for each individual \n",
    "hour. The difference in actual labor and optimal labor is used to identify understaffing and overstaffing \n",
    "periods in the dataset.  \n",
    "In order to estimate the revenue function and cost  function for each store, we make the following \n",
    "assumptions. First, we assume that the revenue fu nction only depends upon the incoming traffic and \n",
    "amount of labor in the store. Second, we assume consta nt marginal cost of labor in our cost function. The \n",
    "manager knows this marginal cost when making staffi ng decisions but this cost is unobservable to the \n",
    "econometrician. We allow for marginal cost to vary  across stores for the following reasons. First, some \n",
    "components of the accounting costs such as minimum wa ge rate, insurance, and medical benefits could \n",
    "vary across stores based on state laws in the United St ates. Thus stores within the same chain would be \n",
